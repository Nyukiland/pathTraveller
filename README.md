# pathTraveller
Mini game where you need to create a path for a character using your tiles

this entire project has been made by myself during my free time. I will update it from time to time.
This is purely a toy and not an actual game, the goal was simple practice tile placement using multidimensionnal array

feel free to do whatever you wish to do with this mini game as long as you credit me and ask for permissions.
this game will be avalable on itch.io on my page
